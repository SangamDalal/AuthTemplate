# Project Template: AuthTemplate

This project template provides a starting point for building applications that require user authentication. It includes the necessary setup and infrastructure for handling user registration, login, and authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

## Features

- User login: Enables users to authenticate and obtain a JWT token for subsequent API requests.
- JWT-based authentication: Implements authentication using JSON Web Tokens for securing API endpoints.
- Authorization middleware: Provides middleware for authorizing API requests based on the JWT token.

## Prerequisites

Before using this project template, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version X.X.X or higher)

## Getting Started

To get started with this project template, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-template.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your preferred IDE or text editor.

3. Configure the database connection:
   
   - Update the `appsettings.json` file.

4. Build and run the project:
   
   - In the terminal or command prompt, run the following command:

     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```

5. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the application.

## Usage

The project template provides a basic authentication setup that you can build upon to create your own application. Here are some guidelines for extending the project:

- Add additional API endpoints: Define new controllers and routes to implement the desired functionality of your application.
- Customize the user model: Modify the `User` class and database schema to include additional user-related properties and data.
- Implement user roles and permissions: Extend the authentication middleware to support role-based authorization.
- Enhance security measures: Consider implementing features like password hashing, password reset, account lockout, etc., to enhance security.

Feel free to explore the project structure, examine the existing code, and customize it according to your project's requirements.
